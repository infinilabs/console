# Gateway Management

Gateway management can quickly and easily help us manage multiple gateway instances.

## Gateway list

The created gateway can be queried in the gateway list

## Gateway registration

The first step is to fill in the gateway address, and enable TLS and authentication as needed (you need to input a user name and password after enabling authentication).

The second step is to confirm the information, and modify the gateway name, tags, and description, as needed.
