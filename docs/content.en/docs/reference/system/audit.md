# Audit Logs

## Introduction

Audit logs are primarily designed to meet compliance requirements, enhance security, support incident investigations, and assist in risk management. They record system operation activities to help detect anomalies, trace the root cause of issues, and identify potential risks. This ensures the secure and stable operation of enterprise information systems while also meeting regulatory requirements.

## Log List

The audit log list displays information such as operation time, operator, operation type, and the type of resource being operated on.
